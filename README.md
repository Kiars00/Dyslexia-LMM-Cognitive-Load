# Grammatical Gender & Dyslexia: Cognitive Load in Morphosyntactic Integration

## Project Overview
This repository contains the statistical pipeline and experimental findings from my **Master’s Project Work in Clinical Linguistics** (Oct 2025). The study investigates how stereotypical bias and grammatical gender agreement interact during real-time linguistic processing in Italian adults with **Developmental Dyslexia (DG)**.

The research is grounded in **Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)**, testing whether reduced reading automatization leads to a "cognitive bottleneck" when processing informational incongruence.

## Methodology & Experimental Design
The study employs a **Grammaticality Maze (G-maze)** task to track processing costs across specific sentence regions:
* **Target Regions:** Determiner, Noun, Verb, Pronoun.
* **Experimental Factors:** 2x2 design crossing Grammatical Gender and Stereotypical Bias (Match vs. Mismatch).
* **Outlier Management:** Implementation of a participant-specific **adaptive threshold** (±2.5 SD) to preserve clinical variance while filtering noise.

## Statistical Modeling (LMM & GLMM)
The analysis utilizes advanced hierarchical modeling to account for the nested nature of psycholinguistic data:

1.  **Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMM):** Applied to log-transformed Reaction Times (RT) for the Noun and Pronoun regions.
    * **Fixed Effects:** Group (DG vs. CG), Grammatical Gender, and Stereotypical Bias.
    * **Random Effects:** Crossed random effects for *Participants* (ID) and *Items* (ID frase).
2.  **Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM):** Applied to accuracy data using a **Binomial distribution** (logit link) to model the probability of correct responses.
3.  **Model Selection:** Competitive testing via **Likelihood Ratio Tests (ANOVA)** and **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** to determine the optimal model fit.

## Key Findings
The results provide strong empirical evidence for the **Cognitive Overload** hypothesis. While neurotypical controls (CG) process stereotypical conflict as manageable "noise," dyslexic readers (DG) exhibit a significant increase in processing costs (Log-IES) and a collapse in accuracy, confirming that social bias acts as a technical barrier to cognitive accessibility.
